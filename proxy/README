1. edit test.sh, then run it.

2. you can visit backend status by :
mysql -P5000 -h127.0.0.1 -uchylli -h123456 -e 'select * from backends'

3. you must have dual-masters to get the result of failsafe.

4. when master A down, then proxy will redirect all of write query to
another master in 2 minutes ( 2 minutes is the proxy's limit, not
mine)

5. you should restart proxy after you fix A. Proxy will not use A
again for writing reuqest again even if A come back. That's because we
want to avoid sync problem.

6. In the future I will add the function to select masters in the
admin port, so we needn't restart proxy

7. Maybe I should write a daemon to check mysql status and order proxy
to switch master if need. And the daemon should switch other slave's
master info.
