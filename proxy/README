put mysql proxy 0.8.1 to some dir

 edit test.sh, then run it.

you can visit backend status by :
mysql -P5000 -h127.0.0.1 -uchylli -h123456 -e 'select * from backends'

you must have dual-masters to get the result of failsafe.

when master A down, then proxy will redirect all of write query to
another master in 2 minutes ( 2 minutes is the proxy's limit, not
mine)

Proxy will not use A again for writing reuqest again even if A come back. That's because we
want to avoid sync problem. you should reset master if A come back and
you want to use it again.

you can set & reset master by run 'set master 1' on admin port

Maybe I should write a daemon to check mysql status and order proxy
to switch master if need. And the daemon should switch other slave's
master info.
